# a summary about you
summary: "I am a **Software Engineer** with **4.5+ years** of experience across a **versatile** set of technologies. I love **automating** boring tasks and creating **innovative solutions** to everyday problems. I completed a **research-based master’s**, where I built a net load demand forecasting tool for Barbados using ML and AI. I also published my thesis, which focuses on several factors that influenced my decision-making and how I arrived at building a robust tool for forecasting Barbados's net load demand. I’m **passionate** about learning, upskilling, and solving **interesting problems**. When I'm not working, I like to tinker with some fun projects such as building my personal streaming service using Jellyfin, self-hosted adblocker service running in my homelab etc."
